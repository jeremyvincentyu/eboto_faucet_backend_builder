This is the backend for the faucet used for beta-testing eBoto. You must install it by running eboto_faucet_backend_builder/deploy.sh from the folder above the git repository. Afterwards, you can start the faucet server by changing directories to the newly created eboto_faucet_backend_runtime and running bash deploy.sh. For the faucet to dispense any keys, you must add private keys in the eBoto-specific JSON private key format into eboto_faucet_backend_runtime/data/voter_keys
